# cse6392_group5

The code enables the Arduino Uno to receive the sensor readings, 
perform computation to detect dehydration, and send the data to a mobile app. 
The mobile app also gives an alarm when dehydration is detected.

You need to install the Arduino IDE. We used Arduino V.1.18.19 for this project.
Libraries required for the implementation:
RemoteXY.h (https://remotexy.com/en/library/)
dht.h 
Adafruit_MLX90614.h (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MLX90614-Library/blob/master/Adafruit_MLX90614.h)

We installed the latest versions of the libraries for this project.



To run, open the code with the Arduino IDE, and click verify to ensure that the code runs properly.
Then you can click upload to upload to your device.
